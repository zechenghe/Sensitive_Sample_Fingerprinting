# Sensitive Sample Fingerprinting

This code demonstrates sensitive-sample fingerprinting in the following paper:

### Download models and data

This demo generates sensitive samples to detect integrity breaches, e.g., neural network trojans, in a deep neural network. Download models and data using [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1awN7O8WC9Pi-f6YQNkzNND3Yh7J22B7B?usp=sharing). The clean and trojaned models (face recognition in Caffe) are obtained from https://github.com/PurduePAML/TrojanNN. The models are transformed from Caffe to Pytorch using [caffemodel2pytorch](https://github.com/vadimkantorov/caffemodel2pytorch).

    git clone git@github.com:zechenghe/Sensitive_Sample_Fingerprinting.git
    cd Sensitive_Sample_Fingerprinting/
    
##### Models


    mkdir model
    cd model

Put `VGG-face-clean.pt` and `VGG-face-traojaned.pt` from the [above link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1awN7O8WC9Pi-f6YQNkzNND3Yh7J22B7B?usp=sharing) under `model/`

##### Data


    mkdir data
    cd data

Put `names.txt`, `VGGFace-Clean/` and `VGGFace-Trojaned/` from the [above link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1awN7O8WC9Pi-f6YQNkzNND3Yh7J22B7B?usp=sharing) under `data/`


### Dependencies

This Pytorch implementaion is based on the following configuration.

Python 3.6.8

Numpy 1.19.5

Pytorch 1.4.0

Torchvision 0.5.0

Pickle 4.0

Matplotlib 3.3.2 (for saving images)

Glob, Pathlib


### Generate sensitive samples

`sensitive-sample-gen.py` is used to generate sensitive samples. The generated sensitive samples are saved in `generated/`.

    python3 sensitive-sample-gen.py --input_dir_clean data/VGGFace-Clean --lr 1e-2 --gpu

To skip sanity check, use `nosanity_check` option. Use `--gpu` to enable gpu (default). Generating around 100 samples should be enough for MANC selection.

### Maximum Active Neuron Cover (MANC) sample selection

`manc.py` performs Maximum Active Neuron Cover (MANC) sample selection. Assume the candidate sensitive samples have been generated in `generated/` folder. This will select a small subset of `n_samples` sensitive samples from a large bag of samples.

    python3 manc.py --n_samples 2 --gpu

Similarly, to skip sanity check, use `nosanity_check` option. Use `--gpu` to enable gpu (default).
